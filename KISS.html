            <p>KISS, one of the most iconic rock bands in the world, was formed in New York City in 1973. The band's original lineup consisted of 
                Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. Known for their distinctive makeup, elaborate costumes, 
                and explosive stage performances, KISS quickly rose to fame in the 1970s.

                and captivate audiences worldwide. KISS has left an indelible mark on the history of rock music, and their legacy lives on.</p>
